DESCRIPTION
===========

Automatically configures system DNS using Amazon Route53.

It creates CNAME entries similar to those created in the dynect cookbook

REQUIREMENTS
============

Chef 0.8+.

An AWS Route53 account.

The `fog` gem. The `fog::default` recipe installs this gem and its dependencies

ATTRIBUTES
==========

The following attributes need to be set either in a role or on a node directly, they are not set at the cookbook level:

* route53.zone - Zone

Example JSON:

    {
      "route53": {
        "access_key": "SECRET_KEY",
        "secret_key": "ACCESS_KEY",
        "zone": "ZONE",
        "domain": "DOMAIN"
      }
    }

EC2 specific attributes:

* route53.ec2.type - type of system, web, db, etc. Default is 'ec2'.
* route53.ec2.env - logical application environment the system is in. Default is 'prod'.

RESOURCES
=========

route53_rr
--

DNS Resource Record.

Actions:

Applies to the DNS record being managed.

* `:create`
* `:replace`
* `:update`
* `:delete`

Attribute Parameters:

* `zone` - DNS zone
* `name` - fully qualified domain name of entry in zone
* `type` - DNS record type (CNAME, A, etc)
* `values` - Record values.
* `default_ttl` - default time to live in seconds
* `access_key` - dyn username
* `secret_key` - dyn password

None of the parameters have default values.

Example:

    route53_rr "webprod" do
      name       "webprod.#{node.route53.zone}"
      type "A"   values([ "10.1.1.10"])
      ttl        node[:route53][:default_ttl]
      access_key node[:route53][:access_key]
      secret_key node[:route53][:secret_key]
      zone       node[:route53][:zone]
    end

RECIPES
=======

This cookbook provides the following recipes.

default
-------

The default recipe installs the `route53` gem during the Chef run's compile time to ensure it is available in the same run as utilizing the `route53_rr` resource/provider.

ec2
---

**Only use this recipe on Amazon AWS EC2 hosts!**

The `route53::ec2` recipe provides an example of working with the Route53 API with EC2 instances. It creates CNAME records based on the EC2 instance ID (`node.ec2.instance_id`), and a constructed hostname from the route53.ec2 attributes.

The recipe also edits resolv.conf to search compute-1.internal and the route53.domain and use route53.domain as the default domain, and it will set the nodes hostname per the DNS settings.

a_record
--------

The `route53::a_record` recipe will create an `A` record for the node using the detected hostname and IP address from `ohai`.
